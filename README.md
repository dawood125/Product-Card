## 🛠️ Built With

- Semantic **HTML5** markup  
- **CSS3** custom properties  
- **Bootstrap 5** utilities (flexbox, grid, spacing)  
- **Google Fonts** (Fraunces & Montserrat)  
- Mobile-first responsive workflow

## 💡 What I Learned

While working on this project, I learned:
- How to **center elements vertically & horizontally** using Bootstrap (`d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center`).  
- How to apply **Google Fonts** to match design specs.  
- Better handling of **card layouts** and hover states for buttons.  

This small challenge helped me strengthen my fundamentals in **frontend styling**.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Make the design fully **responsive for mobile and tablet**.  
- Add simple animations (hover effects on image/card).  
- Use **CSS Grid** alternative layout for practice.
